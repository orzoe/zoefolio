<h2>
  Optimizing In-Store Offer for Mobile
</h2>   
<p class="lead">
  After we launched the first version of TrialPay's In-Store Offer Program with responsive design, I wanted to further opitmize the mobile experience. I proposed a new design with interactive prototype.

      I joined Gleam when it was only a few months old. 
      It just started raising seed money and its product vision was in incubation. 
      The high-level promise is <strong>a comprehensive personal finance management service</strong> 
      that will bring you peace of mind and save you money in the long run. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      The founding team consisted of 1 founder, 1 chief marketing officer, 2 engineers, and me as the designer. 
      Besides raising money, our top priority was to produce a closed beta <em>as soon as possible</em>
      so we can validate our concepts with real users and their real financial data. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I started by <strong>interviewing prospective users</strong> and 
      <strong>evaluating exisiting products/services</strong> out there (e.g. Quicken, Mint, Pocketsmith, HelloWallet, Check, Manila, etc.).
      Meanwhile, I worked side-by-side with the engineers to design and build out an ambitiously wide range of features. 
      These include calendar, to-do list, bill payment, transaction aggregation, 
      secured message, notification, document management, data visualization, etc. 
      Most of the time, instead of writing out detailed specs, 
      I either <strong>coded up prototypes</strong> that can later be turned into production code 
      or directly <strong>implemented the front-end</strong> in order to speed up the turn-around time. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      At the end of my 5 months there, we had a clear direction for the product beta and
      a fully working web app <span class="camouflage">but still no funding...</span>
